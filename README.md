This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over arrays.  The `BuggyArraySum.java` file contains code with the error, resulting in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The corrected version, `CorrectedArraySum.java`, shows how to fix the issue by properly handling the loop condition.
